    "Before modelling, we will first split the data into the train and test sets. This ensures that that we do not violate one of the golden rules of machine learning: never use the test set for training. As EDA can help guide the choice and form of model, we also may want to split the data before EDA, to avoid peeking at the test data too much during this phase. However, in practice, we may need to investigate the entire data during EDA to get a better idea on how to handle issues such as missingness, categorical data (and rare categories), incorrect data, etc.      \n",

You can have a look at the documentation: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html. Note that `train_test_split` defaults to randomly sampling the data to split it into training and validation/test sets, that is, the default value is `shuffle=True`  \n",

This ensures that, every step including randomness, will produce the same output if we re-run the code or if someone else wants to reproduce our results (e.g. produce the same train-test split).\n",

    "In `sklearn`, the suggestion to control randomness across multiple consecutive executions is as follows: \n",

    "- In order to obtain reproducible (i.e. constant) results across multiple program executions, we need to remove all uses of `random_state=None`, which is the default.\n",

    "If we wish to test over a specific set of parameter values using cross validation we can use the `GridSearchCV` function from the `model_selection` submodule. In this setting, the hyperparamer is actually the degree of the polynomial that we are investigating. \n",
    "\n",
    "This argument is a dictionary containing parameters names as keys and lists of parameter settings to try as values. Since we are using a pipeline, our parameter name will be the name of the pipeline step, `pre_processing`, followed by `__`, (then, the name of next step if applicable, e.g. `poly__` since we are using `ColumnTransformer`), and then the parameter name, `degree`. So for our pipeline the parameter is named `pre_processing_poly__degree`. If you want to list the names of all available parameters you can call the `get_params()` method on the model object, e.g. `polyreg_pipe.get_params()` here."
