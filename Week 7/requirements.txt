##### TensorFlow-related packages
# TensorFlow is much easier to install using Anaconda, especially
# on Windows or when using a GPU.
#
# If you have a TF-compatible GPU and you want to enable GPU support, then
# replace tensorflow-serving-api with tensorflow-serving-api-gpu.
# Your GPU must have CUDA Compute Capability 3.5 or higher support, and
# you must install CUDA, cuDNN and more: see tensorflow.org for the detailed
# installation instructions.
