    "# Week 3: Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we will work through a set of problems clustering, another cannonical form of unsupervised learning. Clustering is an important tool that is used to discover homogeneous groups of data points within a heterogeneous population. It can be the main goal in some problems, while in others it may be used in EDA to understand the main types of behavior in the data or in feature engineering.   \n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by generating some artificial data, and then we will utilize clustering algorithms described in lectures and explore the impact of feature engineering on the solution. We will then attempt to find clusters in a gene expression dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, the worksheets will be completed in teams of 2-3, using **pair programming**, and we have provided cues to switch roles between driver and navigator. When completing worksheets:\n",
    "\n",
    ">- You will have tasks tagged by (CORE) and (EXTRA). \n",
    ">- Your primary aim is to complete the (CORE) components during the WS session, afterwards you can try to complete the (EXTRA) tasks for your self-learning process. \n",
    ">- Look for the 🏁 as cue to switch roles between driver and navigator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions for submitting your workshops can be found at the end of worksheet. As a reminder, you must submit a pdf of your notebook on Learn by 16:00 PM on the Friday of the week the workshop was given. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you work through the problems it will help to refer to your lecture notes (navigator). The exercises here are designed to reinforce the topics covered this week. Please discuss with the tutors if you get stuck, even early on! "
